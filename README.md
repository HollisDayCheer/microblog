User Story~~~~~~~~~


User will be able to add local content to their microblog. It should at least save locally so they can keep a sort of memo diary object on their computer. Every time a user uses it they should have to take a couple of seconds just basking in the cleanness of the design because I did such a good job (NOTE: I AM WAY TO BAD AT CSS + HTML TO ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY, SORRY).

User will be able to add minute notes for their web browsing session, jotting down quick ideas. When they do them they should be able to delete them from the list, or maybe even add additional comments. (NOTE: THE REMOVE FUNCTION IS BROKEN AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT BUT IT WORKS IF YOU ONLY EVER REMOVE THE LAST ITEM FROM THE LIST. AS FOR THE COMMENTS IT seems like it needs a super huge amount of html + css for me to get right, and I can't figure out how to save them to local storage with my current configuration, so I just gave up on it.)
